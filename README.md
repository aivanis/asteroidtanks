This is the readme file for "Asteroids and Astral Tanks".
This is an inf1 op project made by Java Tutorial Group 14 for the 2012/2013 Year group.

14/02/2013 Update: Added the libraries, slick2d and lwjgl
				   It will now be necessary for you to have slick2d and lwjgl and set up in
				   in order to work.
				   
				   Slick2d and lwggl are available from thier respective sources and set up 
				   information can be found in the Slick wiki.
